          <ul class="mt-4 space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
            <li>• What you're really trying to build (not the vague story you tell others).</li>
            <li>• Where you're leaking time, money, and attention.</li>
            <li>• What to stop doing, what to double down on, and what to test next.</li>
            <li>• How to build systems so growth doesn't depend on firefighting.</li>

              I always dreamed of starting my own business but jumped in without much planning and quickly felt overwhelmed by operations, finances, and growth decisions. My conversation with Gautham was different — instead of generic advice, he helped me get to the root of my struggles and supported my ideas with clarity and empathy.

              As a first-time founder, I believed everything would be solved by building more infrastructure. Gautham helped me understand the importance of demand-first thinking and saved me months of wasted effort. His questions trigger clarity the way few mentors can.
